# Changelog

The format of this changelog is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Unreleased

### Added

  - `load_parameter_set` (exported from `SchematicDrivenLayout`) loads a `ParameterSet` from a
    YAML file path. Requires `YAML.jl` to be loaded.
  - `split_t_junctions!` (exported from `DeviceLayout`) injects foreign vertices onto edges
    (straight or `Paths.Turn`/`Paths.BSpline`) using an `RTree`-based noding core, with three
    methods: asymmetric `(targets, sources...)` for general 2D / GDS-gap use, single-argument
    `(regions)` for self-noding shorthand, and symmetric all-pairs `(groups::AbstractDict)`
    that injects each group's vertices onto every other group's edges — the form needed to
    make adjacent physical groups conformal before `render_conformal!`. Curved edges are split
    natively via `Paths.split`; no discretization.
  - `SemanticMeta` is now totally ordered (`Base.isless` on `(layer, index, level)`), so it can
    key a sorted collection. In particular the all-pairs `split_t_junctions!(groups::AbstractDict)`
    can be keyed directly by `SemanticMeta`, giving deterministic all-pairs ownership without a
    caller-supplied `Symbol` key.

### Fixed

  - `render_conformal!` now handles `Ellipse` primitives (including circles
    produced by `Circle` and by autofill patterns). Previously `to_primitives`
    kept ellipses as native OCC primitives, but the conformal-emit dispatch had
    no `Ellipse` method, so `render_conformal!` on any `CoordinateSystem`
    containing an ellipse fell through to the generic vector path and errored.
    Circles route through `CurvilinearPolygon` (four 90° arcs), the same contour
    a circular hole comes out of `difference2d_curved`, so a placed circle and a
    boolean-cut circular hole at the same location share cached arc entities.
    Non-circular ellipses (not exactly arc-representable) emit a native
    `add_ellipse`; a smooth closed curve has nothing to share with neighbours.

### Changed

  - Added a precompile workload for the schematic workflow. Precompilation will take longer, but
  first execution in all subsequent new Julia sessions will be faster.
  - `Route` and `RouteComponent` now have their concrete `RouteRule` type as a second type parameter
  (after coordinate type). This should not have functional consequences for ordinary usage, but it
  does mean that `Route{T}` and `RouteComponent{T}` are no longer concrete, and their `RouteRule` cannot
  be changed in-place to a different type.

### Removed

  - `ArrayEntity`, an unexported and undocumented wrapper that presented an array of
    `GeometryEntity` as a single entity. Use a plain `Vector` of entities instead.

## 1.18.1 (2026-09-07)

### Fixed

  - Curve recovery (`union2d_curved` and friends) preserves arcs from path nodes styled with
    `Plain` or `OptionalStyle` (as produced by `not_simulated`/`only_simulated` and friends),
    which previously fell back to discretization.
  - The `Rounded` style now works on `Paths.Node` with `Straight` or `Turn` segments
  - Fixed KeyError in `_collect_mesh_control_points!` when a group emits no samples

## 1.18.0 (2026-08-24)

### Added

  - OpenCascade SolidModel rendering adds radius-sized mesh control points at the centers of
    exact circular arcs by default, locally capping rounded-corner and path-turn mesh sizes
    at the radius when `mesh_scale() <= 1`, without refining their entire enclosing entities.
    For `extrude_z!` postrender operations, generated perimeter and curvature controls are
    repeated along the extrusion.
    Pass `curvature_sizing=false` to `render!` or `render_conformal!` to retain perimeter-only sizing.
  - Graphics export accepts a layout-coordinate `bbox` viewport, a `metadata_filter` passed
    through to `flatten`, configurable `dpi`, and transparent, white, black, or RGB(A) backgrounds.
    `layercolors` may use exact `GDSMeta` keys to distinguish datatypes on the same GDS layer.

### Fixed

  - Mesh control-point sets that resolve to the same `(h, α)` no longer overwrite one another
    when the default grading parameter is applied.
  - Graphics export now preserves aspect ratio when only `width` or `height` is supplied, rather than
    capping width-only output at 288 pixels high. If neither is supplied, the maximum dimension is capped at 4 inches. Reference bounding boxes render again, and GDS layers
    above 255 receive palette colors instead of all falling back to black.
  - Path termination and `SimpleNoRender` halos now use constant-offset edges instead of the generic
    functional-offset fallback. The rendered discretization of these halos on curves may change but 
    will be geometrically equivalent within tolerance.
  - `SolidModels.revolve!` now accepts unitful axis points and directions, converting point
    coordinates to the solid-model unit and direction components to a common unit. Unitless
    points and directions remain supported.
  - `SolidModels.dimtags` applied to a vector of physical groups now returns a flat vector of
    `(dimension, tag)` tuples, as its docstring specifies, instead of a vector of per-group
    vectors.
  - `SolidModels.remove_group!` applied to a collection of group names now returns a flat
    (empty) dimtag vector, so it can be used as a postrender operation. Previously it returned
    a vector of vectors and raised a `BoundsError` when the postrender machinery assigned the
    result to a physical group.
  - `addstyle!(d::StyleDict, s::GeometryEntityStyle, node::Clipper.PolyNode)` no longer throws
    an `UndefVarError`. This documented form of `addstyle!` referred to an undefined name in
    its body, so it never worked; the equivalent `d[node] = s` spelling was unaffected.
  - `rem_node!` now removes the node from a `SchematicGraph`'s name lookup as well as from its
    node list. Previously the removed node stayed reachable as `g.<id>`, and using it then
    failed obscurely — with a `MethodError` mentioning `Nothing`, or a `KeyError` whose key is
    the whole `ComponentNode` — instead of reporting that the node had been removed.

## 1.17.0 (2026-08-10)

### Added

  - Corner rounding now handles **arc-arc corners** (where two circular arcs meet), in
    addition to straight-straight and line-arc corners. `Rounded` fillets such a corner with
    an arc tangent to both adjacent arcs, honoring `p0`/`inverse_selection` like the other
    corner types, on both the GDS and `SolidModel` paths. New exports
    `Curvilinear.arc_arc_cornerindices` and `Curvilinear.rounded_corner_segment_arc_arc`.
  - Added recursive `merge` and `merge!` support for `ParameterSet`, with later sources taking
    precedence and no mutable parameter data shared with the sources. `merge!` rebuilds the
    destination's namespaces, so scoped views held from before the merge are stale and must be
    re-derived.
  - Added `extract_parameter_set(g::SchematicGraph)` to create a detached parameter tree from
    supported final graph-component values, including defaults and recursively realized
    composite subgraphs while preserving attached top-level metadata. Scalar leaves and
    one-dimensional `AbstractArray`s including ranges and views are retained as plain vectors;
    unsupported custom values such as `Point`s are omitted.
  - Added in-place style helpers `only_simulated!` and `only_solidmodel!` to match the in-place versions
    of `not_simulated!` and `not_solidmodel!`. All eight style helpers (in-place and out-of-place versions)
    are exported from `.SchematicDrivenLayout`.
  - The style helpers `not_simulated!` and `not_solidmodel!` now recurse through all references
    to structures of any valid type. Previously array references and non-`CoordinateSystem` structures
    raised a `MethodError` part-way through the traversal. References to `Path`s are handled by
    replacing the `Path` with an equivalent `CoordinateSystem` containing its references and its undecorated
    nodes separately.
  - `round_layer` and `round_layer!` apply corner rounding to the rendered geometry of a
    layer as a post-render pass. The layer's elements (including those inside references)
    are flattened and unioned before rounding, so corners are rounded correctly where
    separately-drawn shapes meet, and holes are preserved. Rounding is symbolic
    (`CurvilinearRegion` with true arcs); for `CoordinateSystem` input, curves already
    present in the layer survive the union exactly when their full discretized footprint
    remains on the result boundary.
  - Added `SolidModels.ConformalRender` submodule with `ConformalRenderContext` and `render_conformal!(::SolidModel, ...)`, an alternative method for rendering to a `SolidModel` that reuses 1D OCC entities where possible, allowing the global fragment-and-map pass to be skipped if preconditions are met.

### Changed

  - `ParameterSet` namespaces are now copied by assignment from another root or scoped
    `ParameterSet`, enabling independent programmatic templates such as
    `design.components.q1 = library.templates.qubit`.
  - Parameter-set YAML output now emits `Unitful.Quantity` values as unquoted plain scalars.

### Fixed

  - The style helpers are now idempotent, and will not change entities that already have the identical
  `OptionalStyle` as their outer style.
  - `ArrayReferences` as `Path` attachments now work with retrieving references and finding transformations (`refs` and `transformation`).
  - `SolidModelTarget` extrusion of levelwise layers treats positive thickness as "away from substrate" at all levels. Previously a levelwise `thickness` vector extruded levels 3 and 4 (and 7 and 8, and so on) toward the substrate instead of away from it.
  - `halo` of a `PeriodicStyle` is now taken substyle by substyle, as for
    `CompoundStyle`. Previously, attachments on the periodic substyles were dropped
    from the halo, and periodic styles starting with a zero-extent substyle produced no halo.

## 1.16.1 (2026-07-28)

### Fixed

  - Zero-length path nodes and compound subsegments with continuous styles (for example a
    zero-angle `Turn`) are ignored during rendering instead of triggering the closed-segment
    check meant for full turns. As a result, zero-length pieces (such as those left around
    overlay terminations) no longer emit degenerate zero-area polygons in rendered output. (#269)
  - Loops removed by styling (`NoRender`, including via `OptionalStyle`/`optional_entity` or a
    `StyleDict` entry, nested inside `Rounded`) expand to no polygons instead of zero-point
    `Polygon`s, which reached `Cell`s and could not be written to GDS. (#269)

## 1.16.0 (2026-07-20)

In addition to new features and bug fixes, this release substantially refactors
rendering of curvilinear entities. Rendered point counts and positions will change,
but the resulting geometry is generally at least as faithful to tolerance.

### Rendering

  - GDS curvilinear rendering (`Turn`, `Trace`, `CPW`, `Strands`, offset segments, corner
    rounding, etc.) is now routed through the same `pathtopolys`/`CurvilinearPolygon`
    pipeline as `SolidModel` rendering, so both backends resolve curves and round
    corners identically.
  - Removed `DeviceLayout.adapted_grid`; all curve discretization is now
    curvature-based and tolerance-controlled via `atol`/`rtol`. The `max_recursions`,
    `max_change`, `rand_factor`, and `grid_step` render keywords no longer have any
    effect.
  - `Turn` and constant-offset `Turn` segments are sampled uniformly instead of marching with the
    general curvature-controlled kernel, making turn discretization faster and avoiding
    over-refinement in some cases. Degenerate turns (zero sweep, zero radius,
    `|offset| == r`) now discretize to exactly two points, and offset turns with
    `|offset| > r` keep exact endpoints.
  - Discretization of a circle (equal-radii `Ellipse`) now uses uniform sampling at the
    tolerance-derived angular step (`circular_arc`) instead of the general
    curvature-controlled kernel, and circles take a fast bounding-box path with no
    discretization.
  - Added a cached arc-length reparameterization to `Paths.BSpline`, making `pathlength`,
    `Paths.t_to_arclength`, and `Paths.arclength_to_t` much faster (~15x for a single
    `arclength_to_t` call). The forward map still uses QuadGK integration; `arclength_to_t` now uses a
    table-seeded Newton iteration (relative tolerance `1e-12`) in place of `Optim`-based
    minimization, so results may differ from previous versions within tolerance.
  - A path node with a 360-degree `Turn` is now split into two half turns during rendering.

### Added

  - Added `recover_curves` and the curve-preserving Boolean variants `union2d_curved`,
    `difference2d_curved`, `intersect2d_curved`, and `xor2d_curved`, which recover
    original curves (arcs, splines) from a clipped result wherever their discretized
    footprint survived the operation intact, returning a `Vector{CurvilinearRegion}`.
  - Added `WithDirection <: GeometryEntityStyle` to annotate geometry entities with a direction (CCW from +x in local frame). The direction transforms with the entity under rotations and reflections, allowing extraction of the final global direction for use in simulation configuration. `ExamplePDK.ChipTemplates.example_launcher` now styles its simulated-only `PORT` rectangle with `WithDirection`, and the `DemoQPU17` solidmodel example extracts port and junction directions with `ExamplePDK.port_directions` instead of computing them by hand (removing the `lumped_direction` keyword from its config-building functions).
  - Added `SolidModels.check_port_connectivity`, using `SolidModels.connected_components` to report ports as `:open`, `:short`, `:floating`, or `:missing`
  - Added `detect_non_boundary_contacts=false` keyword argument to `SolidModels.connected_components`; when `true`, 1d edges embedded in the interior of 2D surfaces (like the feet of staple air bridges) will be treated as connecting
  - Added `examples/DemoQPU17/solidmodel.jl` demonstrating large-scale SolidModel construction and configuration, including a check for open charge lines and shorted flux lines with the new functionality above
  - Parsing and serializing a `ParameterSet` to/from YAML now supports arrays of `Unitful` quantities (e.g. `[0μm, 25μm, 50μm]`), matching scalar handling

### Fixed

  - `Rounded` applied to a dimensionless polygon or `CurvilinearPolygon` now treats a
    real-valued radius as an absolute length by default (pass `relative=true` to
    `round_to_curvilinearpolygon` for length-relative fillets).
  - Rendering an offset segment with a `CompoundStyle` now throws an `ArgumentError`.
  - Fixed composite rounding of a `ClippedPolygon` dropping its holes (#241). Internally, `CurvilinearRegion` now normalizes holes to clockwise winding on construction (matching `ClippedPolygon` hole contours), and `to_polygons` reconstitutes the region with a single positive-fill `union2d` instead of `difference2d`, so hole subtraction no longer depends on input winding.
  - Fixed bug where exact floating point comparison in `autofill` could lead to a gridpoint on an interior edge being filled
  - Fixed `RelativeRounded`'s element-type fallback to use the preferred coordinate type instead of bare `Unitful.μm`, avoiding unit-promotion errors when selecting a rounding point (`p0`) without an explicit coordinate type
  - Fixed a nested-rounding parity check in line-arc corner rounding that caused an error for repeated rounding with identical radius

## 1.15.0 (2026-06-14)

  - Added `SolidModels.populate_size_fields!(cs::AbstractCoordinateSystem)`
so the size-field control points can be built from a `Schematic` (or any
coordinate system) with no `SolidModel` and no geometry kernel.
  - Renamed `ExamplePDK` component parameters to follow the component style guide
    (`<feature>_<dimension>` naming, `_count`/`_trace`/`_radius`/`_gap` suffixes, no
    `w_`/`h_`/`l_`/`n_` prefixes or non-searchable names) and added length-type
    annotations to absolute `rounding` parameters. Affected components include
    `ExampleChip`, `ExampleSeriesClawCapacitor`/`ExampleShuntClawCapacitor`,
    `ExampleSimpleJunction`/`ExampleSimpleSQUID`, `ExampleTappedHairpin`,
    `ExampleFilteredHairpinReadout`, `ExampleClawedMeanderReadout`, `ExampleStarTransmon`,
    `ExampleStarIsland`, and `ExampleRectangleTransmon`/`ExampleRectangleIsland`. Magic
    numbers in `ExampleStarTransmon`/`ExampleStarIsland` geometry were extracted to
    parameters. `ExamplePDK` makes no API-stability guarantee, so these are not treated
    as breaking changes to DeviceLayout.jl.

## 1.14.0 (2026-05-28)

  - Added `ParameterSet`, a nested dictionary wrapper with dot-access for reading and
    writing design parameters, plus `resolve` and `leaf_params` helpers
    - Added a `ParameterSetYAMLExt` weak-dep extension loaded via `using YAML` that
    enables `ParameterSet(path::String)` / `ParameterSet(io::IO)` construction and
    `save_parameter_set` with Unitful round-tripping
    - Added `SchematicGraph(name, ps)` to carry a `ParameterSet` on the graph, plumbed
    through `_build_subcomponents` via `parameter_set(graph)` and
    `create_component(T, ps, address)`
    - Added `set_parameters(c, ps, address; kwargs...)` and the scoped form
    `set_parameters(c, sub::ParameterSet)` for the templates-aliasing pattern:
    overlay `ParameterSet` leaves on top of a template instance, with optional
    composite-level kwargs winning over the overlay. Unknown leaves under the
    address surface as `ArgumentError` at composite-build time
  - Added `SchematicDrivenLayout.footprint_halo` for implementing fast custom halos with less boilerplate
  - Added optional `rtol` keyword argument for `render!`/`to_polygons` to allow larger features to be rendered with relaxed tolerance; if provided, curves are discretized with tolerance `max(atol, rtol * local_curvature_radius)`
  - Added `StyledHook <: Hook`, which wraps a hook with a `Paths.Style`; `Path` and `RouteComponent` hooks are now `SyledHooks`
  - Added graph-level `terminate!`, which fuses an open or short path termination to a specified node and hook, with cross-section for termination provided by the hook (if a `StyledHook`) or by the user
  - Docs: Added SolidModel section to FAQ/Troubleshooting addressing common issues and suggesting a debugging checklist
  - Fixed `Path` intersections on mixed coordinate contexts
  - Fixed issue where rendering keyword arguments could be dropped for compound segments with non-compound styles
  - Fixed overly-strict `Ellipse` and `Circle` constructors to allow different center and radius coordinate types
  - Fixed incorrect loading of GDS array references with nonzero origin

## 1.13.0 (2026-04-28)

  - Added layerwise Booleans `union2d_layerwise`, `difference2d_layerwise`, `intersect2d_layerwise`, and `xor2d_layerwise`
  - Added `clip_tiled` for tiled clipping of large polygon sets
  - Added `Polygons.area`
  - Normalized rotation angles to [0, 360) when writing GDS files
  - `Path` now uses the preferred coordinate type (`typeof(1.0UPREFERRED)`) when the coordinate type is not explicitly specified; use `Path{T}(...)` or (e.g.) `Path(nm, ...)` for explicit control
  - `offset` now returns polygons with interior cuts instead of separate outer and hole contours when holes are present
  - Deprecated `cliptree(op, s, c; kwargs...)` in favor of `clip(op, s, c; kwargs...).tree`
  - Fixed bug where `default_parameters` would throw an error if `@compdef` parameter defaults referenced earlier parameters
  - Fixed overly-strict argument types for polygon clipping methods
  - Fixed `selection_tolerance` not being forwarded when applying a transformation to a `Rounded` style
  - Fixed `perimeter(::ClippedPolygon)` to sum over all outermost contours rather than just the first
  - Fixed errors when rendering or clipping an empty `ClippedPolygon`
  - Fixed degenerate cases in line-arc corner rounding that could produce `NaN` values or arcs too small for SolidModel rendering

## 1.12.0 (2026-04-13)

  - Added `auto_union` SolidModel rendering option; if `true`, self-unions every 2D group before any other postrendering (default `false`)
  - Added `skip_unused_layers` SolidModel rendering option; if `true`, entities in layers not referenced by postrendering operations or `retained_physical_groups` are not rendered (default `false`)
  - Added `SolidModels.connected_components`, which takes a group or collection of groups and returns the connected components of entities in those groups as vectors of `(dim, tag)` tuples
  - Added tolerance-based `to_polygons` rendering for CurvilinearPolygon and CurvilinearRegion (no longer using a fixed 181 points per curve)
  - Improved efficiency of autofill point-in-polygon algorithm
  - Fixed `uniquename` not being called on default route names in some schematic routing methods
  - Fixed ClippedPolygon rendering bug that allowed keyhole cuts to pass through other holes

## 1.11.2 (2026-03-31)

  - Fixed unit promotion in rounding that could hit a Unitful bug (Unitful.jl#845)
  - Fixed `kwargs...` forwarding for CurvilinearRegion `to_polygons`

## 1.11.1 (2026-03-30)

  - Fixed dispatch error for rounding of styled entities introduced by 1.11.0
  - Fixed relative radius handling in line-arc rounding
  - Fixed `circular_arc([θ1, θ2], ...)` method so `θ1 = θ2` gives a vector with a single point rather than `nothing`

## 1.11.0 (2026-03-23)

This release adds line-arc corner rounding and improves SolidModel robustness:

  - Added support for rounding line-arc corners in `CurvilinearPolygon` and the SolidModel rendering pipeline, extending the `Rounded` style which previously only handled straight-straight corners
  - Changed SolidModel fragment recipe to fragment adjacent dimensions pairwise, fixing `PLC Error` failures when meshing geometries with extrusions at multiple height levels
  - Added `hash` and `==` for `Straight` and `Turn` path segments; also fixed `BSpline` hash and equality to give consistent results for equivalent segments with different `Unitful` unit choices
  - Improved `plan` performance by caching `hooks` results per component, avoiding redundant recomputation

Several bugs have also been fixed:

  - Fixed `render!` overwriting user-provided path metadata with default `GDSMeta()` when rendering a `Path` to `Cell`
  - Fixed `show` for empty `Cell`
  - Fixed `extent` calculation for `SimpleStrands` with more than one strand
  - Fixed error computing halo of a taper with inner delta
  - Fixed operator precedence in 45-degree routing double turn check
  - Fixed `CompoundRouteRule` default `leg_lengths` type (`Vector{Int}` instead of `Vector{Float64}`)
  - Fixed `route!` with `CompoundRouteRule` using wrong length for default style vector
  - Fixed `direction` for zero-angle `Turn` to avoid division by zero

## 1.10.0 (2026-03-04)

This release includes several new features and fixes involving Path styles:

  - Added `Paths.PeriodicStyle`, which cycles between substyles in a repeating sequence
  - Added `margin` keyword to `terminate!` to allow terminating a specified distance before the end of the path
  - Added `Paths.round_trace_transitions!` for splicing rounded tapers between `Trace` styles
  - Added `overlay_index` keyword to `terminate!` to allow applying terminations to overlay styles
  - Fixed incorrect behaviors when extending certain `Paths`: overlay styles continue as overlays, while terminations continue as `NoRenderContinuous`
  - Fixed incompatibility issues for combinations of compound, decorated, overlay, and termination styles
  - Fixed bug where zero-length path segments could cause SolidModel rendering to fail
  - Fixed bug where a generic taper inside a `simplify`-ed path would lead to an error thrown in rendering
  - Fixed bug where references in a decorated style applied as an overlay would be ignored by `halo`

There are also several minor features and fixes:

  - Added `SchematicDrivenLayout.filter_parameters` for sharing parameters between composite components and subcomponents
  - Added `rename_duplicates` option to `GDSWriterOptions`
  - Added experimental Text entity support to graphics backend
  - Fixed bug where `map_metadata!` would map multiply-referenced structures multiple times
  - Fixed bug where `@composite_variant` would not forward `map_hooks` to base variant when defined with component instance rather than type

The documentation has also been reorganized and improved:

  - Moved API reference material to separate pages
  - Added several tutorials
  - Added a style guide for component definition
  - Improved or expanded several sections, including explanation of rendering and solid models

## 1.9.0 (2026-02-09)

  - Added `SingleChannelRouting`, which allows multiple paths to be routed in parallel in the same `Channel` (defined by a path with a trace style), entering and exiting the channel in different places
  - Added memoization for B-spline optimization (`auto_speed`), so a given curve only needs `auto_speed` to do any computation once per Julia session
  - Changed default CPW mesh size to use `2 * min(trace, gap)` (higher element quality when trace and gap are very different)
  - Changed default global mesh grading from `0.9` to `0.75` (more robust meshing for complex geometries, relatively small cost)
  - Changed threshold for GDSII layer/datatype number spec warning to 32767; added `GDSWriterOptions` to configure this
  - Fixed `SolidModel` rendering issue where some exterior boundaries might not be tagged
  - Fixed breaking error with `apply_size_to_surfaces=true` supplied via `MeshingParameters`; it is still deprecated as of 1.8.0 and has no effect, but no longer throws an error

## 1.8.0 (2026-01-05)

  - Mesh size fields are no longer controlled via `PhysicalGroup` internally, this change
    allows for changing the size field associated to a `SolidModel` after `render!` via the
    global parameters accessed in `MeshSized`. This reduces the number of entities in any
    global boolean operations, improving performance, along with separating the concerns of
    rendering and meshing thereby improving user experience.

  - Deprecated `SolidModels.MeshingParameters` in favour of new `mesh_scale`, `mesh_order`,
    `mesh_grading_default` accessed from `SolidModels`. Removed `apply_size_to_surfaces`.
  - Improvements to `SolidModels.render!` to improve stability and performance.

      + Changed `SolidModels.restrict_to_volume!` to perform a check if the simulation domain
        already bounds all two and three dimensional objects, if so skips operation.
      + Changed `SolidModels.render!` to incorporate a two stage `_fragment_and_map!` operation,
        reconciling vertices and segments before reconciling all entities. This improves the
        robustness of the OpenCascade integration which can error in synchronization if too much
        reconciliation is required all at once by `fragment`.
      + These two operations in conjunction with the removal of `MeshSized` entities results in
        a ~3x performance improvement in rendering the QPU17 example to `SolidModel`, and ~4.5x
        reduction in time from schematic to mesh.
  - Fixed Julia 1.11+ performance regression for B-spline optimization.

## 1.7.0 (2025-11-26)

  - Added `xor2d` for polygon XOR

  - Improved support for wave port boundaries in a `SolidModel`

      + `SolidModelTargets` now take `wave_port_layers`, a list of layer symbols used to define wave port boundary conditions
      + Added support for `LineSegment` in SolidModel
      + Added `add_wave_ports!` to automatically place wave port boundaries where specified paths/routes intersect the simulation area
      + Added option to use wave ports instead of lumped ports in the single transmon example
  - Fixed bug where `Rounded` might incorrectly not apply to a `ClippedPolygon` with a
    negative.
  - Introduced `selection_tolerance` for `Rounded` which allows a rounding style to not
    select a point unless it is within a tolerance of the target. This defaults to infinite,
    but in a future major release will be reduced to a value consistent with floating point arithmetic.
  - Improved rendering performance for curves and circles

For developers, the test suite now uses the TestItem framework, and new benchmarks have been added to the benchmark suite.

## 1.6.0 (2025-10-16)

  - Improved metadata handling for `LayoutTarget` and `SolidModelTarget`

      + SolidModelTargets will now ignore `NORENDER_META` (the `:norender` layer)
      + SolidModelTargets now take `ignored_layers`, a list of layer symbols which are not rendered
      + LayoutTargets now allow overriding the mapping of `GDSMeta` by setting `target.map_meta_dict[my_gdsmeta] = my_override`, allowing changes to different `GDSMeta` or `nothing` rather than always mapping a `GDSMeta` to itself

  - Changed `remove_group!` SolidModel postrendering operation to use `remove_entities=true` by default, fixing the unexpected and undesired default behavior that only removed the record of the group and not its entities
  - Changed routing errors to be logged instead of throwing exceptions, so that a "best-effort" route is always drawn
  - Changed graphical backend to display everything in the entire reference hierarchy by default, rather than only displaying the contents of the top-level coordinate system
  - Added default metadata map, so that a CoordinateSystem or Component with SemanticMeta can be rendered directly to a Cell for quick GDS inspection
  - Added graphical `show` method for CoordinateSystem (like what `Cell` already had), so `julia> my_cs` or `julia> geometry(my_component)` will display the geometry if graphical output is available (for example, in the Julia for VS Code REPL)
  - Added dark theme for graphical output (lighter colors that look better on dark background) and `DeviceLayout.Graphics.set_theme!(theme)` for `"light"` (default) and `"dark"` themes
  - Changed ellipse rendering to use `atol` for absolute tolerance by default (supplying `Δθ` keyword will still use that as angular step)
  - Deprecated `circle` in favor of `Circle` (exact circle entity) and `circle_polygon` (discretized by angular step)
  - Deprecated `rounded` keyword in SolidModel rendering; supplying `Δθ` keyword alone will discretize ellipses

## 1.5.0 (2025-10-10)

  - Added `auto_speed`, `endpoints_curvature`, and `auto_curvature` keyword options to `bspline!` and `BSplineRouting`

      + `auto_speed` sets the speed at endpoints to avoid sharp bends (minimizing the integrated square of the curvature derivative with respect to arclength)
      + `endpoints_curvature` sets boundary conditions on the curvature (by inserting extra waypoints)
      + `auto_curvature` B-spline sets curvature at endpoints to match previous segment (or to zero if there is no previous segment)
      + Both `endpoints_speed` and `endpoints_curvature` can be specified as two-element iterables to set the start and end boundary conditions separately

  - Added `spec_warnings` keyword option for `save` to allow disabling warnings about cell names violating the GDSII specification (modern tools will accept a broader range of names than strictly allowed by the specification)
  - Added `unfold` method for point arrays to help construct polygons with mirror symmetry
  - Added FAQ entry about MeshSized/OptionalEntity styling on Paths
  - Fixed incorrect conversion and reflection of split BSplines
  - Fixed issue causing duplicate `Cell` names with paths and composite components, where rendering would use the component's name rather than a unique name

## 1.4.2 (2025-07-16)

  - Removed invalid keyword constructor without type parameters for `@compdef`-ed components with type parameters, so it can be overridden without warnings
  - Fixed `1` character in PolyTextSansMono
  - Fixed autofill exclusion in DemoQPU17
  - Removed stale Memoize.jl dependency
  - Minor documentation improvements

## 1.4.1 (2025-07-08)

  - `SolidModels.check_overlap` now skips empty groups
  - Built-in components `Spacer`, `ArrowAnnotation`, and `WeatherVane` now default to coordinate type `typeof(1.0UPREFERRED)` if no coordinate type is specified in the constructor
  - Improvements to ExamplePDK/DemoQPU17 component mesh sizing
  - Minor documentation improvements

## 1.4.0 (2025-07-01)

  - Added `SolidModels.check_overlap(::SolidModel)` for checking overlap of physical groups in a `SolidModel`
  - `Path`s containing offset B-splines and other arbitrary curves are rendered to `SolidModel` more quickly and using fewer entities for B-spline approximation
  - Rendering keyword `atol` now controls tolerance of B-spline approximation of offset B-splines and other arbitrary curves when rendering to a `SolidModel` (default tolerance remains `1.0nm`)

## 1.3.0 (2025-06-06)

  - Added `set_periodic!` to `SolidModels` to enable periodic meshes
  - `CompositeComponent` geometry now preserves subcomponents instead of replacing them with `CoordinateSystem`s, unless `build!` is called explicitly on the composite component's schematic or the parent schematic
  - Minor documentation improvements

### Fixed

  - `DecoratedStyle` and `CompoundStyle` are no longer missing any of the methods `width`, `trace`, or `gap` (forwarded to the underlying style)
  - `GeometryEntity` interface methods (`lowerleft/upperright/bounds`, `footprint`, `halo`) for `StyledEntity` now fall back to underlying entity as documented;
    specialized behavior for `NoRender` and `OptionalStyle` is preserved but now documented
  - `halo(c::ClippedPolygon)` is now consistent with the halo of an `AbstractPolygon` vector containing `c`, using the clipped polygon itself rather than its `bounds`
  - `footprint(::ClippedPolygon)` now uses outer contour if there's only one (and `bounds` otherwise, as before)

## 1.2.0 (2025-04-28)

  - Composite components can define `_build_subcomponents` to return a `NamedTuple` with keys that differ from component names
  - `Turn` segments with `SimpleTrace` or `SimpleCPW` styles now use `atol` to determine the discretization; this is faster and in some cases more accurate than the fallback method using `adapted_grid`

### Fixed

  - Rounding no longer fails when available length is less than `min_side_len` only due to numerical precision issues
  - Circular arcs in rounded polygons will no longer occasionally produce very short edges near the endpoints, and are instead now drawn with equally spaced points including the endpoints
  - Added missing `hash` and `convert` methods for `ScaledIsometry`

## 1.1.1 (2025-04-16)

  - Improved performance of nested `CompositeComponent`s by storing hooks after first computation
  - Improved performance of `ComponentNode` global transformation calculations by traversing the coordinate system hierarchy bottom-up
  - Updated compat for MetaGraphs.jl to require 0.8, fixing precompilation on Julia v1.12 beta

## 1.1.0 (2025-04-07)

  - Added `generate_pdk`, `generate_component_package`, and `generate_component_definition` to `SchematicDrivenLayout` to help users create packages and files from templates
  - Lowered default for meshing parameter `α_default` from `1.0` to `0.9` to improve robustness
  - Docs: Added closed-loop optimization example with single transmon
  - Docs: Updated to clarify that `build!` is not necessary

### Fixed

  - `launch!` without rounding now has the correct gap behind the pad
  - `terminate!` with `initial=true` appends the termination before the `Path` start as documented (previously incorrectly kept `p0(path)` constant, shifting the rest of the `Path` forward)
  - `terminate!` with rounding on a curve is still drawn as straight but keeps the full underlying segment (previously consumed some turn angle to replace with straight segment including rounding length)

## 1.0.0 (2025-02-27)

Initial release.
