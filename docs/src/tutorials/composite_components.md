# Tutorial: Composite Components

In [Building a Component](building_a_component.md), you created a component with geometry defined directly in `_geometry!`. In [Schematic Basics](schematic_basics.md), you connected components in a schematic graph. A `CompositeComponent` combines both ideas: its geometry is defined by an internal schematic of subcomponents. In this tutorial, you'll build a simple transmon qubit as a composite of a capacitor island and a Josephson junction.

## What You'll Learn

- Defining a `CompositeComponent` with `@compdef`
- The three required methods: `_build_subcomponents`, `_graph!`, `map_hooks`
- Forwarding parameters to subcomponents
- Inspecting composite geometry and hooks
- Using a composite component in a schematic

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Building a Component](building_a_component.md) tutorial
- Completed [Schematic Basics](schematic_basics.md) tutorial

## Setup

```@example composite
using DeviceLayout, DeviceLayout.PreferredUnits
using DeviceLayout.SchematicDrivenLayout
using DeviceLayout.SchematicDrivenLayout.ExamplePDK
using DeviceLayout.SchematicDrivenLayout.ExamplePDK.LayerVocabulary
using FileIO
nothing # hide
```

We import `ExamplePDK` and its `LayerVocabulary` because we'll use existing ExamplePDK components as subcomponents, and the layer constants (like `METAL_NEGATIVE`) are defined in `LayerVocabulary`.

## Step 1: Inspect the Subcomponents

Before building our composite, let's look at the two components we'll compose. `ExampleRectangleIsland` is a rectangular capacitor island with a surrounding gap. `ExampleSimpleJunction` is a placeholder Josephson junction.

```@example composite
import DeviceLayout.SchematicDrivenLayout.ExamplePDK.SimpleJunctions:
    ExampleSimpleJunction
import DeviceLayout.SchematicDrivenLayout.ExamplePDK.Transmons:
    ExampleRectangleIsland

island = ExampleRectangleIsland()
println("Island hooks: ", keys(hooks(island)))
```

```@example composite
junction = ExampleSimpleJunction()
println("Junction hooks: ", keys(hooks(junction)))
```

The island has hooks including `:junction` (where the junction attaches), `:readout`, `:xy`, and `:z`. The junction has two hooks: `:island` (meets the island metal) and `:ground` (meets the ground plane). Our composite will fuse the island's `:junction` hook to the junction's `:island` hook.

## Step 2: Define the Composite

A `CompositeComponent` uses `@compdef` just like a regular `Component`, but inherits from `CompositeComponent` instead of `Component`. Where a `Component` implements `_geometry!` and `hooks`, a `CompositeComponent` implements three different methods: `_build_subcomponents`, `_graph!`, and `map_hooks`.

```@example composite
@compdef struct SimpleTransmon <: CompositeComponent
    name = "transmon"
    cap_width = 24μm
    cap_length = 520μm
    cap_gap = 30μm
    junction_gap = 12μm
    junction_pos = :bottom
    island_rounding = 0μm
    w_jj = 1μm
    h_jj = 1μm
end
nothing # hide
```

The parameters include both island parameters (`cap_width`, `cap_length`, `cap_gap`, `junction_pos`, `island_rounding`) and junction parameters (`w_jj`, `h_jj`). The composite owns all parameters and forwards the relevant subset to each subcomponent. The `junction_gap` parameter is shared — it controls both the island's gap on the junction side and the junction's total height.

## Step 3: Build the Subcomponents

The first required method is `_build_subcomponents`. It returns a `Tuple` of subcomponent instances. Each subcomponent's `name` field determines its key in the `NamedTuple` that `_graph!` receives.

```@example composite
function SchematicDrivenLayout._build_subcomponents(tr::SimpleTransmon)
    # Create the island, forwarding matching parameters
    @component island = ExampleRectangleIsland(
        cap_width = tr.cap_width,
        cap_length = tr.cap_length,
        cap_gap = tr.cap_gap,
        junction_gap = tr.junction_gap,
        junction_pos = tr.junction_pos,
        island_rounding = tr.island_rounding,
    )

    # Create the junction, forwarding its parameters
    @component junction = ExampleSimpleJunction(
        w_jj = tr.w_jj,
        h_jj = tr.h_jj,
        h_ground_island = tr.junction_gap,
    )

    return (island, junction)
end
nothing # hide
```

We use the `@component` macro to create each subcomponent — this automatically sets the component's `name` from the variable name. Notice how `junction_gap` on the composite maps to `junction_gap` on the island and `h_ground_island` on the junction — the composite provides a unified interface even when subcomponents use different parameter names for related or derived quantities.

!!! tip "filter_parameters in real PDKs"
    DeviceLayout provides [`filter_parameters`](@ref) to automatically find parameters that share names between the composite and a subcomponent. This is convenient when many parameters pass through unchanged, but for this tutorial, explicit forwarding is clearer. See `ExampleRectangleTransmon` in the ExamplePDK source for this pattern.

## Step 4: Wire the Internal Graph

The second required method is `_graph!`. It receives an empty `SchematicGraph`, the composite instance, and a `NamedTuple` of the subcomponents (keyed by their names). You populate the graph using the same `add_node!` and `fuse!` operations from the [Schematic Basics](schematic_basics.md) tutorial.

```@example composite
function SchematicDrivenLayout._graph!(
    g::SchematicGraph,
    comp::SimpleTransmon,
    subcomps::NamedTuple
)
    island_node = add_node!(g, subcomps.island)
    return fuse!(g, island_node => :junction, subcomps.junction => :island)
end
nothing # hide
```

We add the island as the first node, then fuse the junction to it. The island's `:junction` hook and the junction's `:island` hook will be placed so they coincide with opposite directions — just like `fuse!` in a top-level schematic.

!!! note "Node ordering"
    The node indices in the graph depend on the order of `add_node!` and `fuse!` calls. The island gets index 1 (first `add_node!`), and the junction gets index 2 (added implicitly by `fuse!`). These indices matter for `map_hooks` in the next step.

## Step 5: Map the Hooks

The third required method is `map_hooks`. It returns a `Dict` that maps subcomponent hooks to user-friendly names on the composite. Without this mapping, hooks get auto-generated names like `:_1_readout` and `:_2_ground`. By defining `map_hooks`, you give the hooks that users will connect to clean, descriptive names.

```@example composite
function SchematicDrivenLayout.map_hooks(::Type{SimpleTransmon})
    return Dict(
        (1 => :readout) => :readout,  # Island's :readout -> composite :readout
        (1 => :xy) => :xy,            # Island's :xy -> composite :xy
        (1 => :z) => :z,              # Island's :z -> composite :z
    )
end
nothing # hide
```

Each entry maps `(node_index => :subcomponent_hook_name) => :composite_hook_name`. Node 1 is the island (the first node added in `_graph!`). We expose three of the island's hooks as composite-level hooks. The remaining hooks — like the junction's `:ground` and the island's `:junction` — are internal to the composite, consumed by the `fuse!` connection. Any unmapped hooks that aren't consumed by fuse connections are still accessible with auto-generated names (e.g., `:_2_ground`).

Note that `map_hooks` dispatches on the **type**, not an instance. This is the common pattern. Instance dispatch (`map_hooks(tr::SimpleTransmon)`) is available when the mapping depends on parameter values — for example, `ExampleStarTransmon` uses instance dispatch because its hook mapping depends on a `right_handed` flag.

## Step 6: Inspect the Result

Let's verify our composite works:

```@example composite
tr = SimpleTransmon()
println("Type: ", typeof(tr))
println("Supertype: ", supertype(typeof(tr)))
```

```@example composite
h = hooks(tr)
println("Composite hooks: ", keys(h))
```

The composite has our three mapped hooks (`:readout`, `:xy`, `:z`) plus auto-named hooks for any unmapped subcomponent hooks.

```@example composite
sc = SchematicDrivenLayout.subcomponents(tr)
println("Subcomponent names: ", keys(sc))
```

## Step 7: Use in a Schematic

A composite component is used in a schematic exactly like any other component. The schematic system treats it as a single node with the hooks defined by `map_hooks`. Fuse it to an XY line `Path` for a simple demonstration:

```@example composite
# Create an XY line to attach to the transmon
xy_cpw = Paths.CPW(4μm, 4μm)
xyline = Path(; name="feedline", metadata=SemanticMeta(:metal_negative))
straight!(xyline, 0.2mm, xy_cpw)
terminate!(xyline; rounding=2μm)

# Assemble the schematic graph
g = SchematicGraph("transmon_demo")
@component my_transmon = SimpleTransmon(cap_length=400μm)
transmon_node = add_node!(g, my_transmon)
spacer_node = fuse!(g, transmon_node=>:xy, Spacer(50μm, 0μm)=>:p1_west)
xyline_node = fuse!(g, spacer_node=>:p0_east, xyline=>:p1)

# Plan the schematic (calculate component positions)
sch = plan(g; log_dir=nothing)
check!(sch)

# Render the geometry
tech = ProcessTechnology(ExamplePDK.LAYER_RECORD, (;))
target = ArtworkTarget(tech)
cell = Cell("transmon_demo")
render!(cell, sch, target)
save("transmon_demo.svg", cell);
nothing # hide
```

```

## Summary

In this tutorial, you learned:

- **`CompositeComponent`**: A component whose geometry comes from an internal schematic of subcomponents
- **`_build_subcomponents`**: Returns a `Tuple` of subcomponent instances with forwarded parameters
- **`_graph!`**: Populates the internal `SchematicGraph` using `add_node!` and `fuse!`
- **`map_hooks`**: Maps `(node_index => :hook_name)` to user-friendly composite hook names
- **Inspection**: `hooks()`, `subcomponents()` to examine the composite structure
- **Usage**: Composite components work identically to simple components in a parent schematic
