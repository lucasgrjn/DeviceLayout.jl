# Tutorial: Schematic Basics

In [Working with Paths](working_with_paths.md), you built a resonator and feedline by manually positioning geometry. In this tutorial, you'll describe a similar device as a schematic — a graph of connected components — and let DeviceLayout handle placement.

## What You'll Learn

- Using a chip anchor to position components
- Connecting components with `fuse!`, `attach!`, and `route!`
- Automatic placement with `plan`
- Rendering with `ProcessTechnology` and `ArtworkTarget`

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Working with Paths](working_with_paths.md) tutorial
- Completed [Building a Component](building_a_component.md) tutorial

## Setup

```@example schematic
using DeviceLayout, DeviceLayout.PreferredUnits
using DeviceLayout.SchematicDrivenLayout
using FileIO
```

## Step 1: Create the path components

We'll build a resonator coupled to a feedline, with launchers at each end. Start by creating three paths, as you learned how to do in the Paths tutorial. We just need to create the paths without worrying about their relative positions. Paths are themselves Components, so they will work in a schematic like any other Component — they'll be positioned automatically based on schematic connections.

First, define a CPW style we'll use throughout:

```@example schematic
cpw = Paths.CPW(10μm, 6μm)
```

The first component is a section of the measurement feedline, a straight CPW:

```@example schematic
feedline = Path(; name="feedline", metadata=SemanticMeta(:metal_negative))
straight!(feedline, 4mm, cpw)
```

Next, a resonator with a shorted start and open termination:

```@example schematic
resonator = Path(; name="resonator", metadata=SemanticMeta(:metal_negative))
straight!(resonator, 200μm, cpw)
turn!(resonator, -90°, 50μm)
straight!(resonator, 300μm)
turn!(resonator, -90°, 50μm)
straight!(resonator, 500μm)
turn!(resonator, 180°, 50μm)
straight!(resonator, 500μm)
terminate!(resonator; initial=true, rounding=3μm, gap=0μm)
terminate!(resonator; rounding=5μm)
```

Finally, a "launcher" (wirebonding pad that tapers to the CPW trace width), which we'll end up using twice:

```@example schematic
launcher = Path(; name="launcher", metadata=SemanticMeta(:metal_negative))
launch!(launcher; trace1=cpw.trace, gap1=cpw.gap)
```

## Step 2: Create a chip anchor

In a schematic, `plan` positions components by traversing `fuse!` connections from a root node. Components connected only by `route!` must already be positioned — routes are resolved *after* placement.

This means we need an anchor to fix the positions of components that aren't directly chained together. A [`Spacer`](@ref) provides compass hooks at two points and has no geometry of its own:

```@example schematic
chip = Spacer(6mm, -2mm; name="chip")
for (hname, h) in pairs(hooks(chip))
    println("$hname: $(h.p), $(h.in_direction)")
end
```

The `p0_*` hooks are at the origin and the `p1_*` hooks are at (6mm, -2mm). We'll use them to position launchers at the chip edges.

## Step 3: Build the schematic graph

Create the graph and add the chip as the root node. The first node stays at the origin:

```@example schematic
g = SchematicGraph("resonator_feedline")
chip_node = add_node!(g, chip)
```

### Fuse launchers to the chip edges

We can use the same component in multiple nodes. Nodes always have unique IDs within the schematic graph; by default, these are generated based on the component name, but we can specify our own with `base_id`.

```@example schematic
launcher_in_node = add_node!(g, launcher; base_id="launcher_in")
launcher_out_node = add_node!(g, launcher; base_id="launcher_out")
```

Paths are components in the schematic system, so they have hooks for specifying conections. Every path has `:p0` (start) and `:p1` (end) hooks:

```@example schematic
h = hooks(launcher)
println("p0: $(h.p0.p), $(h.p0.in_direction)")
println("p1: $(h.p1.p), $(h.p1.in_direction)")
```

[`fuse!`](@ref) creates rigid connections: it specifies that the second node will be positioned so that the two hooks coincide with opposite directions.

```@example schematic
fuse!(g, chip_node => :p0_west, launcher_in_node => :p0)
fuse!(g, chip_node => :p1_east, launcher_out_node => :p0)
```

The input launcher's pad is at the left edge (origin) with the path extending east. The output launcher's pad is at the right edge (6mm) — `fuse!` rotates it so its hook direction opposes `:p1_east`, which makes the launcher extend west.

### Chain the feedline from the input launcher

The feedline connects to the input launcher's narrow end:

```@example schematic
feedline_node = fuse!(g, launcher_in_node => :p1, feedline => :p0)
# Equivalent to:
# feedline_node = add_node!(g, feedline)
# feedline_node = fuse!(g, launcher_in_node => :p1, feedline_node => :p0)
```

Notice that we did not call `add_node!` for `feedline` first. When given a bare component (not yet in the graph), `fuse!` adds the node automatically and returns it.

### Attach the resonator to the feedline

[`attach!`](@ref) connects a component to a specific point along a path, rather than to a named hook. This is a schematic-based analogue of how you used `attach!` in [Working with Paths](./working_with_paths.md) to place a reference to the resonator along the feedline.

Typically, you'd write something like `attach!(g, feedline_node, resonator_node => :feedline, 2mm, location=1)` to position a resonator's `:feedline` hook 2mm along and on the right side of the path. However, we made a choice to work with bare Paths as lightweight components, and the bare Path doesn't have such a hook at the necessary position and orientation.

Instead, place a resonator at a coupling position on the feedline using a Spacer:

```@example schematic
resonator_node = add_node!(g, resonator)
# This won't attach with the desired spacing and orientation
# attach!(g, feedline_node, resonator_node => :p0, 2mm, location=1)
# So we'll attach another Spacer
coupling_gap = 5μm
spacing = coupling_gap + Paths.extent(cpw)
coupling_spacer_node = attach!(g, feedline_node, Spacer(0μm, -spacing) => :p0_south, 2mm; location=1)
fuse!(g, coupling_spacer_node => :p1_west, resonator_node => :p0)
```

In practice, you'll usually avoid needing the `Spacer` by defining your own resonator component with the necessary hook. However, it may be a useful exercise to think through how this Spacer results in the desired resonator position.

The `location=1` offsets the attachment to the right side of the feedline trace, as though with a feedline hook pointing back towards the trace ("north"). The `:p0_south` hook on the spacer points opposite that hook already, so `attach!` does not rotate it. The resonator then fuses to the `:p1_west` hook, by orienting its `:p0` hook in the opposite direction ("east"). Since the `:p0` hook points along a path's initial direction, the initial direction of the resonator path is "east". 

Meanwhile, thanks to the Spacer, the path starts at a point `spacing` below the edge of the ground of the feedline CPW; since `spacing = coupling_gap + Paths.extent(cpw)`, the width of the ground plane between the feedline and resonator is `coupling_gap`.

### Route the feedline to the output launcher

The feedline end and the output launcher's narrow end are both positioned, but they don't coincide — there's a gap between them. [`route!`](@ref) creates a flexible path that will be computed after placement:

```@example schematic
route_node = route!(g, Paths.StraightAnd90(50μm),
    feedline_node => :p1, launcher_out_node => :p1,
    cpw, SemanticMeta(:metal_negative))
nothing # hide
```

[`Paths.StraightAnd90`](@ref) routes using straight segments and 90° bends with a minimum bend radius of 50μm.

## Step 4: Plan and render

`plan` traverses the `fuse!` connections to position components, then resolves routes between the now-positioned endpoints:

```@example schematic
sch = plan(g; log_dir=nothing)
```

To see that our components are now positioned, we can get geometric information based on the schematic and a node of our choice:

```@example schematic
println("Resonator bounds: Rectangle($(bounds(sch, resonator_node).ll), $(bounds(sch, resonator_node).ur))")
println("Resonator center: $(center(sch, resonator_node))")
println("Resonator origin: $(origin(sch, resonator_node))")
println("Resonator global transformation: $(transformation(sch, resonator_node))")
println("Resonator p1 hook: $(hooks(sch, resonator_node).p1)")
```

Our route now has endpoints, and we can construct its path:

```@example schematic
routed_path = SchematicDrivenLayout.path(component(route_node))
println("Route length: $(pathlength(routed_path))")
```

`check!` validates design rules (component orientations, etc.) and must be called before rendering:

```@example schematic
check!(sch) # No relevant design rules here
```

To render the schematic to GDS, we need a target that maps semantic layer names to GDS layers. In the [First Layout](first_layout.md) tutorial, you did this manually with a `Dict`. [`ArtworkTarget`](@ref) wraps a [`ProcessTechnology`](@ref) to handle it automatically:

```@example schematic
tech = ProcessTechnology(
    (; metal_negative=GDSMeta(0)),
    (;)
)
target = ArtworkTarget(tech)
```

The first argument to `ProcessTechnology` is a `NamedTuple` mapping semantic layer symbols to `GDSMeta`. The second is process parameters (empty here).

Render and save:

```@example schematic
cell = Cell("resonator_feedline", nm)
render!(cell, sch, target)

save("resonator_feedline.gds", cell)
save("resonator_feedline.svg", cell);
nothing # hide
```

```@raw html
<img src="../resonator_feedline.svg" style="width: 5in;"/>
```

## Summary

In this tutorial, you learned:

- **`Spacer`**: An anchor component with compass hooks for positioning other components at fixed locations
- **`fuse!`**: Rigid connections that position components during planning — hooks coincide with opposite directions
- **`attach!`**: Connects a component to a specific point along a path
- **`route!`**: Flexible connections resolved after placement — endpoints must already be positioned by `fuse!`
- **`plan`**: Traverses `fuse!` edges to compute positions, then resolves routes
- **`check!`**: Validates design rules (required before rendering)
- **`ProcessTechnology` and `ArtworkTarget`**: Structured mapping from semantic layers to GDS layers
