"""
    recover_curves(op, plus, minus; report=nothing)

Run a boolean operation `op` on `plus` and `minus`, then recover original curves from the
discretized result wherever they survived the operation intact. Returns
`Vector{CurvilinearRegion}` — one region per outer contour in the clipped result (each
disjoint piece becomes a separate region).

## Positional arguments

The first argument `op` must be one of the polygon clipping operations: `difference2d`,
`union2d`, `intersect2d`, or `xor2d`.

The second and third arguments (`plus` and `minus`) accept the same forms as the
corresponding clipping operation: a `GeometryEntity` or array of `GeometryEntity`, a
`GeometryStructure` or `GeometryReference` (whose flattened elements are used), or a pair
`geom => layer` selecting only elements in those layers from the flattened structure.

Curve-bearing entities have their curves tracked through discretization and recovered in
the result: `CurvilinearPolygon`, `CurvilinearRegion`, `Path` nodes (e.g. `Turn`/`BSpline`
segments rendered with a `Style`), equal-radii `Ellipse`s (represented exactly as four 90°
arcs), and `Rounded`-styled `Polygon`/`Rectangle`. All other entities are discretized via
`to_polygons`.

## Keyword arguments

`report` may be a `Vector` that will be filled with `(status, curve, contour_index)` tuples
tracking recovery results. `status` is `:recovered` if the curve's entire discretized run
survived the boolean operation intact, or `:clipped` if it was cut and fell back to a
polyline. `contour_index` is the 1-based index of the output contour where the curve was
recovered, or `0` for `:clipped` curves.

## Return type

Returns `Vector{CurvilinearRegion}` (one region per outer contour). This differs from
`difference2d` and similar functions, which return a single `ClippedPolygon`. Callers
migrating from `difference2d(a, b)` to `recover_curves(difference2d, a, b)` must handle a
vector result.

## Limitations

**All-or-nothing recovery:** A curve is recovered only if its entire discretized run (the
sequence of integer-grid vertices produced by `discretize_curve`) survives the boolean
operation with exact integer equality. If the operation cuts through a curve, that curve is
reported `:clipped` and falls back to a polyline. Partial-curve recovery is not supported.
